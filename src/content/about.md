I’m a fourth-year student at McMaster University studying Electrical Engineering. In my free time, I enjoy gardening, playing sports, running, hiking, and playing the guitar! I'm fascinated by robotics & autonomous systems, and the math & software behind it all.

I know for sure that I want to travel the world. One of my many life goals is to explore the planet and experience new places, cultures, and cuisines! There's a whole different world beyond our borders I can't wait to experience it. So, if you have any travel recommendations, please let me know and I'll add it to my already-overfilled travel bucket list!
