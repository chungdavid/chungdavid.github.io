I’m a final-year student at McMaster University studying Electrical & Biomedical Engineering. I'm fascinated by robotics & autonomous systems, and the math & software behind it all. My current interests, presented very broadly, are:
    
1. Exploring ways to ensure that learning-based methods used in robot perception and control, either separately or end-to-end, are provably safe.
2. Developing perception and control systems for mobile robots that are robust in dynamic and noisy environments.

In my free time, I love playing sports, running, hiking, and playing the guitar!
