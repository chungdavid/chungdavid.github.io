description: BackTrack is a web app that tracks the user's posture in real-time using live video feed from their webcam, and notifes them when they are slouching. This project was inspired by my last co-op, where my work related to human pose estimation. I also have an interest in back pain as you can tell from my previous projects. Overall, this project was a great way to improve my React skills!
