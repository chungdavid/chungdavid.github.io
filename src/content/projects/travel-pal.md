description: Given my travel interests, it only makes sense that I work on a project related to it! TravelPal is a website where users can recieve practical travel information based on the country they're travelling to. I developed this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, and the travelbriefing.org API. I learned a ton from this project, as it was my first time working with CSS grid, local storage, and APIs!
skills: [Figma, HTML/CSS, Vanilla Javascript, Adobe Illustrator]
