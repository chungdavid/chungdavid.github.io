title: Back Inspector
date: 2021-01-01
description: After reading a book about back pain, I decided to create Back Inspector - an online tool where users can recieve a self-assessment of their back pain by answering 14 questions. I created this project to improve my web development skills and reinforce some of the concepts I learned from the book.
skills: [Figma, HTML/CSS, Vanilla Javascript]
