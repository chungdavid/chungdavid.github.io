description: This website, currently in its 1st version, is my first ever web development project. I created it with the goal of improving my graphic designing skills and learning web development. My logo & avatar were designed on Adobe Illustrator and the website was designed on Figma and built responsive & mobile-first with pure HTML, CSS, & Vanilla Javascript. I decided to build this website from scratch to truly gain a strong understanding of web development.
