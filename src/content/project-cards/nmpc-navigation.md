title: NMPC Navigation Pipeline in Simulation
filters: [Robotics]
date: 2024-07-01
description: This project presents a navigation pipeline inspired by the paper "Optimization-Based Autonomous Racing of 1:43 Scale RC Cars" (Alexander Liniger, Alexander Domahidi, Manfred Morari). Through this project, I learned more about formulating an MPC and a quadratic programming problem.
skills: [ROS2, C++, OSQP]
