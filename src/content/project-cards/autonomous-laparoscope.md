title: Autonomous Laparoscope (in progress)
filters: [Robotics]
# date: ..
description: Capstone project in collaboration with PCIGITI. A hands-free laparoscope autonomously driven by a robotic arm. This system removes jitter common in human-driven laparoscopes, while freeing up a surgical assistant for higher-value tasks during a laparoscopic procedure. This project presents the tool tracking problem, which has relevance in both robotic surgery and robot-assisted surgery, and presents an interesting control problem due to the RCM constraint.
